"""Persistent cross-chat memory service.

Owns the memory.md file at ~/.lumen/memory.md. The file is mounted
read-write into every conversation container at /memory.md so the model
can read and update it using its file tools (view, str_replace, create_file).

Other modules should import from here rather than touching the file directly:
  - container_service.py  calls ensure_file() to get the host path for mounting
  - chat_turn_service.py  calls read() to inject memory into the system prompt
